steps:

step 1:
Draw a map and make parameters usable (display on output and info). Possibly make things pretty

step 2:
Build a model that contains villages and make them run themselves for 5 year. (Make it possible for people to reproduce and die.)

step 3:
Enable road building and transportation in some manner.
do
step 4:
Make functional networks that are build relatively intelligently.

step 5:
Debug for a few days.

step 6:
Run the model and show to Esa ==> receive all credit.

step 7:
Implement other models.

step 8:

repeat{
    debug()
}until(time ends)
